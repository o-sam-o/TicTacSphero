# Tic-Tac-Sphero

## Introduction
This is a project done at the AT&T Casual Gaming Hackathon 2012. This app uses some code from MacroLab, created by Orbotix, with permission. This app requires 9 spheros arranged in a grid, and will light up a sphero when a player chooses a square to put a piece on the Tic-Tac-Toe board on the phone. It runs on Android 2.2 or higher.
